Computer and Information Systems Project

This course required me to take all that I've learned and develop a final project. I first developed a proposal with background research. My proposal was to build a flashcard application in Android, because I was travelling through South America at the time and thought it would be useful for learning Spanish words. I had looked at other learning applications and other flashcard applications, and wanted to combine features of both to create a more useful piece of software.

While travelling, I took time when I could to work on the code, following a modified waterfall model of software development. I eventually completed a piece of software which allows users to create and store flashcards on their mobile device. Each card has 2 sides, where the user can input any text they like. Cards can be arranged into sets, which the user can also create. Another key feature of the app is that it tells you when the optimal time to test yourself on the information you have stored. The algorithm follows current learning research and creates a test using multiple choice and other methods of testing. Finally, there is also a simple matching game that users can play where the application selects random cards and has the user match the back term to the front term in a 'Memory' style game.

After completion, I wrote up a final report analyzing my application. You can find all documentation and source code here.

To run the software, you can use the files to open up an Android studio project, or install the debug apk on any Android mobile device.
